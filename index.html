                            require constant updating. Furthermore, some veterinary-specific programs have special

                            knowledge is required.

                        <p>
                            Gone are the days of hiring someone to come run phone wiring all throughout your facility,
                            leaving you with a line and not much else. Today, we use state-of-the-art VoIP phone
                            technology. VoIP stands for “Voice over IP” and it’s basically phone-via-internet. It’s
                            easier to install, configure, maintain, and–best of all–it’s more affordable (up to 50% more
                            affordable!). you not only save on the costs of installation, calls themselves are
                            significantly less expensive.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>With VoIP you can effortlessly customize your telephone system. Voicemail, messages, hold
                            music–it’s all at your fingertips. You can even seamlessly transfer calls between practice
                            locations, whether they’re next door, or in the next county.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>We set you up with a full suite of phone features. All the traditional stuff you’re used to,
                            plus call hold, call transfer, call hunt conference calling, find/follow me, and
                            auto-attendant phone menus. We can even have your recordings voiced by professional voice
                            actors.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Virtual faxing (also called IP faxing) is another feature of VoIP phone systems. Even in the
                            age of email and instant communication, there are some instances when faxes are necessary.
                            Without the need for paper or toner, you can send and receive faxes using the email account
                            you already have with a hosted VoIP system.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Switching to VoIP means having your cake and eating it too–everything you like about
                            traditional phones, plus all the benefits of modern features.</p>

                            dollars to get an entirely new setup to maintain peace of mind. We aim to find a solution
                            before such drastic measures are required.

                            data is safe and secure in the cloud. Not only that, if a device is ever lost or stolen, we
                            can track it as well as ensure that all data is locked down, away from prying eyes.
